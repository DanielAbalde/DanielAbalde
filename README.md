### Hi there 👋,
- 🦚 Currently developing Peacock (3d jewelry plugin for Rhinoceros and Grasshopper), when job and social life permits.
- 📖 I write seriously in C#, and sometimes I play with Processing in JavaScript.
- 🦗 Maybe I'm not a good Grasshopper teacher, my last student's boss hired me.

#### About
- 🌦️ I'm from [Vigo](https://www.google.com/search?q=vigo+playa+de+samil&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjeiPep88zvAhURohoKHd3cCdIQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=vigo+playa+de+samil&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB46AggAOgYIABAFEB46BAgAEB5QxFpYjmhgzmloAHAAeACAATeIAboFkgECMTSYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=d0VdYJ7xKpHEat25p5AN&bih=912&biw=1920&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB823GB823) but I am in London since 2018. I need more sun. 
- 🍍 I am fascinated about procedural modelling, morphogenesis, differential geometry, AI and data design.
- 💖 When I need to feel better I jam with a drumpad and a piano midi.
- ✨ But the only thing I'm good at is finding cool problems and obsessing over them until I solve them.
