### Hey there 👋,
I am a creative coder, a designer/artist with the superpowers of programming. Here you will find a bit about me, my most popular projects, and how to get in touch.

#### About me
- 🦗 Senior computational designer. I have 10 years of experience developing plugins for Grasshopper (3d procedural modelling plugin for Rhino3d) and using code to solve art, product design and architecture professional projects. 
- 🖼️ I speak graphics. My daily language is C#, but I also know Javascript, Solidity, GLSL, Java, Visual Basic and a bit of many others. I play with Processing, WebGL or A-Frame for fun (ask me for my p5.js portfolio).
- 🦚 Pushing digital jewellery. My main industry is jewellery, being the developer of Peacock (3d jewellery framework) in my spare time; and working on 3d product configurators and improving modelling workflows at a bespoke jewellery startup in London.
- 🏷️ Tokenising digital assets. I'm exploring how NFTs and programmable digital assets can solve several problems.
- 💎 I want to get back to my designer side. Check out some of my old designs from my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DanielAbaldeDesigner).
- 💖 I love complex things. I'm fascinated by procedural geometry, morphogenesis, digital data design, AI and many other fields of knowledge and creativity.
